About snippify
====================

**Snippify** is a web-app for storing online code snippets. It was created and
is now maintained by Alexandru Plugaru (sasha at snippify me) to experience 
Django Web framework goodness. Also the awesome UI designer that made the 
layout of this website, CSS and a lot of testing is 
Andrei Zahariade (http://random-pixels.com/) - you're the best dude :D
 
Obviously I and probably you need an app like this to store our own recipes.
 
It started as a simple project for posting snippets with syntax highlighting 
(thanks Pygments!), but now it's rather social with a REST interface which can 
be used using these plugins in different IDE's and Firefox
 
The best part of all is that this is a FLOSS project so the code of this 
website and plugins are freely available on `github`_ so feel free to grab it 
or contribute.
 
Happy snippifying!
